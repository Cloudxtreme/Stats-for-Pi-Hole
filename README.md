# Running from source

Git clone this repository and then run npm install or yarn. After that just run npm start or yarn start

# First Run
Remember to open settings and enter your hostname, it needs to be with HTTP or HTTPS, and then add what interval you want to use for fetching.

To get a token logon to your Pi-Hole click settings, then API tab and click Show Token.

# Problem?

Publish an issue here on github and I will look at it




Remeber this is just a small app as a hobby but I will maintain it as good as I can. Hope you enjoy it :)

# Token
To get a token you need to logon to your Pi-Holes admin page, click settings, API and then show token.

This is a third party application, and may not always work with the latest version of Pi-hole.
