# PiDNS Stats

A mac app for looking at DNS Blocker stats, just a simple tray app.

# First Run
Remember to open settings and enter your hostname, it needs to be with HTTP or HTTPS, and then add what interval you want to use for fetching.

# Problem?

Publish an issue here on github and I will look at it




Remeber this is just a small app as a hobby but I will maintain it as good as I can. Hope you enjoy it :)
