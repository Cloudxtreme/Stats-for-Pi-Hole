# Running from source

Git clone this repository and then run npm install or yarn. After that just run npm start or yarn start

# First Run
Remember to open settings and enter your hostname, it needs to be with HTTP or HTTPS, and then add what interval you want to use for fetching.

# Problem?

Publish an issue here on github and I will look at it




Remeber this is just a small app as a hobby but I will maintain it as good as I can. Hope you enjoy it :)
